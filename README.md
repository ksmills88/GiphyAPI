# GiphyAPI

In this silly veggie themed website, you can see gif's of some of your favorite veggies (or fruits, or whatever you'd like, really). Either click one of the current buttons for some common results, or get curious and add a button for something like 'Brussel Sprouts' by adding it via the searchbar to see what Giphy spins up for you. Search at your own risk, ratings are displayed.

When you click a button, the Giphy API gets called using the value of the button clicked, and results of the Gif's are displayed on the page.
